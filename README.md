# Human Risky Decision-Making (HURD) Toolkit with PyTorch Backend

This reporsitory is a fork of the original [HURD](https://github.com/jcpeterson/hurd) repository, with the backend changed from JAX to PyTorch.

**NOTE:** HURD is currently in a pre-release state and thus may contain bugs while being actively developed. We are currently working on more complete documentation. For now, see the quick start guide in the `tutorials` folder.

HURD implements the Mixture of Theories (MOT) model of human risky decision-making along with several other models and baselines (e.g., Prospect Theory) from the paper listed below using Python and PyTorch. It was written by Joshua Peterson and David Bourgin, and is currently a work in progress.

# Basic Usage

```python
from hurd.internal_datasets import load_c13k_data
from hurd.optimizers import Adam
from hurd.models.mixture_of_theories import MixtureOfTheories

# load human data from Peterson et al. (2021)
human_data = load_c13k_data()
# data can be split with a method yeilding a generator
splitter = human_data.split(p=0.9, n_splits=1, shuffle=True, random_state=1)
# here we just want one split
(train_data, val_data) = list(splitter)[0]

# setup an optimizer
optimizer = Adam(lr=0.01, n_iters=2000)

# initialize a model
model = MixtureOfTheories(
    optimizer=optimizer,
    loss_function="mse",
)

# fit the model parameters
model.fit(dataset=train_data, val_dataset=val_data)
```

More examples can be found in the `tutorials` folder of this repository.

# Requirements

The most important requirement for HURD-torch is PyTorch, which is used for general comutation and differentiation.

The requirements are specified in `requirements.txt`.

# Datasets

HURD includes a copy of risky choice datasets from the paper, but the original release of the data can also be found [here](https://github.com/jcpeterson/choices13k).
